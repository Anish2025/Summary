# AI Agent Week 4.2 : Agentic Tools and MCP Protocols

## Introduction

AI agents can effectively interact with their environment and perform tasks through standardization, specifically using the Minimum Context Protocol (MCP), and by leveraging tools, fine-tuning, collaboration, and prompt optimization.

## The Four Pillars of Agentic Systems

The lecture outlines four foundational pillars:
- **Prompt Engineering**:It  is the practice of crafting effective inputs to guide AI models toward producing desired and accurate outputs.
- **Tooling**: set of software tools and frameworks used to build, manage, and optimize AI workflows and applications.
- **Fine-Tuned Agents**: Includes supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.    
- **Collaboration**: Effective multi-agent coordination.
    

## Understanding Tools in Agentic Systems

Agents interact with their environment using:
- **Sensors and Actuators**: Representing perception and action.    
- Tools = Actuators (in traditional definitions).
    
When using LLMs as agents:
- Example: Asking about the weather → requires access to external APIs or data (web, weather API).

## Proliferation of Agentic Frameworks

Mentioned frameworks:
- **Crew AI**, **LangGraph**, and others.
- All are evolving towards the concept of an **Agentic Operating System**.

Emphasis on creating tools using:
- **Crew AI**
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

- **Standardization Need**: To handle tool overload and avoid fragmented libraries.
- MCP compared to REST:
    - Inspired by REST’s simplicity and minimalism.
    - Contrasts with heavyweight predecessors like SOAP.
        

### MCP exposes three main resources:
- **Tools**: Functional modules that perform computations or actions.
- **Resources**: Passive data or lookup endpoints.
- **Prompts**: Shareable, reusable prompt templates.
    

Key distinctions:
- **Tools** involve computation.
- **Resources** are typically lookups.
- **Prompts** are underused but valuable.

## Implementation of MCP Tools
- Crew AI has poor MCP support.
- MCP tool creation tasks for the lab:
    - **Weather Tool**
    - **Quote of the Day Tool**
    - **FedEx Tool** (rate calculator)
    - **RAG-to-Riches**: RAG-based quote tool for animals.

## Intelligence in Tools and Agent Composition

- **Tools can be intelligent agents themselves.**
- Agents may use other agents as tools → enables nested reasoning.
- MCP supports this recursive tool-agent architecture.

## MCP Setup and FastMCP Usage

- **Installation**: Use `uv` to add `fast-mcp`.
- **Tool Definition**:
    - Stateless Python functions with strong documentation.
    - Use `@mcp.tool` decorator to expose.
        
- **MCP Server Startup**: `mcp.run()` launches the server.

## Discovery and Metadata Description

- Tools must be clearly documented. 
- Tool descriptions act as prompts/context for agents.
- Tool use depends heavily on metadata quality.
    



## Benefits of MCP: Elimination of Client Code
- Traditional approach: write custom clients for every API.
- MCP standardizes interaction → no code required.
- MCP = Universal agent-tool API interface.
- Greatly simplifies integration across heterogeneous systems.

## Tool Collision and Selection Strategy
- If multiple tools serve the same purpose, confusion arises.
- Recommended: use a proxy MCP server to curate a subset of tools.
- Agents then register with only that proxy.

## Microservices Parallel and Adoption
- MCP tools = REST endpoints of microservices.
- Tools are described using natural language for agent compatibility.
- Adoption is widespread (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, etc.).
## Agent Tool Discovery and Prompting
- Agent can auto-discover available tools from MCP.
- Manual specification is optional but sometimes preferred for precision.
- Performance impact from scanning is negligible.

## Key Takeaways
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) standardizes how agents use tools, prompts, and resources.
- Tools act as actuators, enabling agents to perform actions like API calls.
- FastMCP allows easy tool creation with simple Python decorators.
- Agents can use other agents as tools, enabling composable, nested reasoning.
- MCP removes the need for custom client code, streamlining integration and discovery.
